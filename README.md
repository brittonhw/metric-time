# metric-time

While we don't know _why_ humans exist, we need not subject ourselves to a deeply flawed and nonsensical timekeeping system. Gone are the horrors of 60s and 24s, of seconds and minutes, and rejoice in the glory our metric time system, and its principle unit, the _**Mour**_ (derived from metric-hour). 

### Ok so what is the mour then?

Good question. The mour is a sensible unit, one that coincides with the glorious base 10 system put forth by the arabic system of counting we have grown so accustomed to. As such, **100 Mours belong to 1 Day.** That's it. Simple. Do you need more precision? Then simply look to metric prefixes, as illustrated in the table below.

| Unit | Hour Multiplier | (Rough) Heretic Time Equivlent |
|---|---|---|
| **Milli**mour | 0.0024 | a little less than a second|
| **Centi**mour | 0.024 | $\approx$ 9 seconds|
| **Deci**mour | 0.24 | $\approx$ minute and a half|
| Mour| 0.24 |  $\approx$  15 mins |
| **Deca**mour | 2.4 | $\approx$  2 and a half hours  |
| **Hecto**mour | 24 |  1 day  |
